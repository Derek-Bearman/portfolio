            <p>Nature. Photography. Graphic design. Music.</p> 
            <p>All of these are beloved interests of mine.</p> 
            <p>However, above all else, my absolute passion lies with the thrill of Adventure.</p>
            <p>Whether it be across the country, around the world, or even in my own backyard — Adventure calls to me!</p>
            <p>I was born and raised in Madison, WI. There is where I came to find the beauty in simplicity.</p>
            <p>Shapes, patterns, lines, symmetry — beautiful simplicity.</p> 
            <p>I’ve always enjoyed art, thanks to the time I had spent all the way back in my first experience with school: "Preschool of the Arts."</p>
            <p>Throughout my entire young life, I would constantly find myself drawing, coloring, and appreciating the simple beauty of the world around me.</p>
            <p>That said, one thing I had always struggled with was keeping a steady hand (I could never be surgeon).</p>
            <p>The year 2014 changed all of that; in fact, it changed entire the rest of my life (still not a surgeon, though).</p>
            <p>In 2014, I discovered the Pen Tool.</p>
            <p>Since then, I have spent literally hundreds of hours on Photoshop, Illustrator, and Indesign, ultimately discovering the amazing medium of self-expression that digital art has provided me.</p>
            <p>My first experience with photography was working at a summer camp in 2016.</p>
            <p>I fell in love.</p>
            <p>With that DSLR Nikon 3200; with nature; with digital imagery; and with the hunger to capture the perfect moment that can only be truly experienced first-hand — I was in love.</p>
            <p>Ever since then, my life has been centered around, not only experiencing what life has to offer, but capturing its simple elegance.</p>
            <p>That is what drives me. That is Jack Whayland photography!</p>
